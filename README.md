# subtitle-adjuster

## Why?

Many times we download a subtitle file to a TV show but it's either faster or slower than your expected.
With this simple program, you can adjust the subtitle show up time by seconds.

## Todo
* ~~Add logging~~
* ~~Add test cases to cover all modules~~
    * ~~files~~
* Provide prompting for user to input the output path he want the new srt to be
    * ~~When no output path provided, it will be defaulted to the same path of the original file~~
    * ~~Backup the original srt file and update the original srt file with the new time~~
* ~~Provide a way quit~~
